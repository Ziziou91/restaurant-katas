# makePositive

It's an hour before closing time and the restaurant is quiet. The front of house has
asked you write up each sale.

Unfortunately, some of the other staff have bad handwriting, and the scanner will think the total has a '-' in front of it, making it looking negative.

• Write a `makePositive` fuction that returns a positive total for each value

# calculateChange

Your table has finished their meal, you've given them the bill
and they have put their money on the table.

• Write a function that works out what change you need to give back to your customers.

• Assume the amount of cash the customer gives you will always be enough.

If you've been given the exact change, return "no change required"
