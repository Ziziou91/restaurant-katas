# restaurant-katas

A collection of coding katas designed to help people new to coding pratcie and test fundamental skills. The katas will be organised by difficulty and topic, with the back-story of a restaraunt being shared by all of the problems. There will be no level of assumed knowledge, and each kata will build on concepts introduced in the previous challenge.

## How to contribute

Before writing a kata, take a look at this:
https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial:-Create-Your-First-Kata

If you have an idea for a kata, feel free to add it to the function in the appropiate file under "library", and the test suite in the "spec" folder.

### When writing your kata, please follow these guidelines:

1. What is the kata helping people practice?
2. Is there already another kata in this collection which tests something similar?
3. Are the instructions clear?
4. is the testing coverage good. This includes random tests?
5. Does it fit in the theme of the other katas?

## Topics

### Fundamentals

- Getting started with Codewars, create a function
- Understanding the console and test results
- Understanding sample tests

### Numbers

- '+' pitfalls, Number()
- Math.floor(), Math.round(), Math.ceil()
- Basic Arithmetic

### Strings

- Contcatenation
- number toString()
- String methods, includes, indexOf, split
- looping over a string

### Objects

- Creating an object
- Accessing object properties and adding properties to an object
- Removing properties from an object
- Checking if an object includes a property
- iterating over an object
